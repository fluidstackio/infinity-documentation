## Welcome to the FluidStack Infinity Documentation

We've created a REST API hosted at [infinity.fluidstack.io/api](https://infinity.fluidstack.io/api) to return JSON data for most common procedures. It's modelled after OpenStack's API with some key differences. **In most situations, a migration from any OpenStack provider to FluidStack requires minimal changes.**

*Thousands of machines are at your fingertips from one API*

## Support

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to [jonathan@fluidstack.io](mailto:jonathan@fluidstack.io) for any help! We are actively developing, so send us feature requests too!
