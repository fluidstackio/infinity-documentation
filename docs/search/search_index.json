For machines that you need now, obviously this isn't ideal. Instead, we've worked with some of our providers to directly integrate into their API. Within 2 seconds, you can place an order for a server that is typically ready within 1 minute Keep in mind that this is only for servers that have fast deployment enabled (see our plans page) Request Our REST API endpoint for plans is available here: POST https://infinity.fluidstack.io/api/deploy/single You need to include the following: Name Type Description api_key String Your API key api_token String Your API token plan String The plan ID to provision name String The hostname of your new server admin_user String Your desired administrator username admin_pass String Your desired administrator password Response Name Type Description success Boolean Whether your request succeeded server Array Array of the following parameters id String ID of the new VM links Array Links to the resource in question Once your request succeeds, you will need to wait for a few minutes for the server to boot up for you to be able to access it.
